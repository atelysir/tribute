        To my very dear mother whom death took away so soon , you lived well and you gave your best to all you do .
        My mother was an inspiring soul , her home was open to everyone and her hospitality made them feel important, she was the most loving , humble , compassionate, understanding, family oriented woman and one of the most beautiful souls one could ever meet
        Dear mom, I’m so grateful for the way I was raised , you were never afraid to be my mum , you thought me right from wrong, you made sure I did my best , you believed in me and was always there for me no matter what
        Writing this tribute to you happens to be the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life because the thought of not seeing you ever again brings so much pain and discomfort. A part of me have been ripped off leaving an empty hole difficult to fill up . I still wonder why death took you away so soon WHY DID DEATH TAKE AWAY THE PRECIOUS JEWEL IN MY LIFE ?
        I will continue to love and cherish the memories we shared until we meet again . Thank you so much for making life good for us all even in death I still cherish and love you so much , continue to rest in peace mom … I miss you so much
                          From your first daughter

        <p><strong><em>A TRIBUTE TO CHINWE NWANNE M <br><br>

        CHINWE NWANNE M (as you fondly call every of your relations), your departure from this universe is so laborious to all of us.
        I have made several attempts to write this tribute but I m always not able to commence because of the weight it lays upon my heart.
        It's too painful and sad to be writing this tribute to you .The pains I feel cannot be expressed in any piece of writing. My eyes have been loaded with tears ever since your peregrination on this universe.
        Sometimes they pour out even when I don't want to cry, at other times, they just hang up in my eyes.
        I can't stop missing you, your calls, jovial and playful nature .You were always so full of life to relate with.
        Growing up as children, you easily made friends such that our mum nicknamed you " UWAJONJO" which means (always favoured).That favour always followed you in all your life endeavors.
        You got married and had all your children. You have left 5 children behind.

        Your house was Haven to a lot of people, even in times of lack, you welcomed anyone who cared to visit, spend sometime or even to live with your family. You were selfless and open minded to everyone.Your kindness was second to none.You were a good mummy to your children and many foster children also.
        Ohhhh !!!!, how they are all missing you. I pray that they will not derail from the Godly and upright training that you gave them AMEN..
        Anytime I spoke to you at the time of your illness you always assured me that you were getting better and stronger.
        Ohhhh death, why? Why my only sister?
        Chii Nwanne M, Daa Chii, it's only God that can console us and grant us the fortitude to bear your painful departure.
        Your husband is in great shock because you were his organizer.You were a strong pillar to him.He has to learn to cope without you.Even in lack, you organised and arranged yourself such that people admired you so much.You were courageous, hard-working and above all strong-willed.
        YOU were looking forward to celebrating your silver jubilee wedding anniversary this Christmas.
        CHINWE VIN, MUMMY GOD'S WILL, Why did you bow out at the prime of your time when life had so much goodies in stock for you? Your children will soon be graduating one after another.You left so many things unsaid and undone.Your good deeds are stored in many peoples treasured memories.
        As a lover of God, you were a worker in RCCG  . You were always involved in the things of the kingdom,evangelism and soul winning.Your children are still expecting their  Sunday school teacher to come and teach them.
        ALAS!! we cannot question God (though I did that).God knows all and he will see us through it all..
        You have finished your race, you handed the baton over to me I promise to live up to expectations by the grace of God.The legacy and sweet memories you left will forever dwell amongst your loved ones.
        Daa Chii, Mummy Godswill , Prosper and Chiboy.Your children are missing you. Your girls (Joy and Kamsi) are hoping that you will come back soon.You left us broken hearted but we are consoled by the WORD OF GOD.
        Sleep on my beloved sister, I know you have gone to be with the Lord. You are in a better place.We love you but God loves you more.
        Till we meet on the resurrection morning.<br><br>
